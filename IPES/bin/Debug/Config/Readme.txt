Instant Pokemon
Transfer Tools

What is it?
IPTS and IPES are programs that allow the user to quickly and efficiantly insert Pokemon Stats into their ROM with minimal effort.

But why?
Well to be quite honest, I'm lazy. And many other hackers out there are too. I'm simply making my life easier and sharing it.

Is it safe?
Who knows! It's currently only in Beta stage so it could blow up in your face or give you free kittens.
But one thing is for sure, it didnt break my test ROM!

What is a TRF file?
A TRF file, or Transfer Reading Filesystem, is a custom made file to work with IPTS without the need of bulky ini files or removing any features. Because of the design of the TRF file, it is 100% future proof. If any new generation of Pokemon are added, you can simply edit them in. That simple!

How do you edit the TRF file??
Well currently you must either edit it by hand with a hex editor or by using the including program(IPES).


Will you be releasing source code?
Maybe once it's done, bug free and properally documented.
